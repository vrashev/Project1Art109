   <div class="about">
 <p>This reporter has discovered as result of Nationwide Poll, that in spite of past year Pandemic conditions, changing lifestyle we all lead, that most people are becoming more positive and creative in their thinking. "What makes us tick?" was out main concern. It has been said that an optimist sees an oportunity in every calamility; a pessimist sees a calamility in every opportunity. 
   We spoke to ordinary people at home and work. We basically asked the same question: "How do you do it, how do you get through your day, what keeps you going?"  The first person we questioned was a woman from Mountain View, California.  Her reply was, "Iger up, get dressed, and I go for it." we asked, "Go for what?", "Shopping, of course." "Shopping was the fine art of acquiring the things you don't need, with the money you don't have, and besides, when the going gets tough, the tough go shopping." Hmm we thought, quite a perceptive human being. 
	Working was a major concern and on the minds of most people questioned. We spoke to a bright young man working at the candy counter at a movie theater at Santana Row. First, we ordered a large buttered popcorn to test the quality of his service and then asked him: "Do you enjoy the challenge of your work?" Handing us our popcorn, he replied, "Hard work may not kill me, but why to take the chance?" "I'd quit my job, but that is the only place I get some stress relieve." 
	Well, questioning inevitably turned to money. Good old money in San Francisco, we stopped a proper-looking citizen and he offered the gem "The golden rule is: the one who has the gold makes the rules" "Can money buy happiness?" we asked one young lady in a Valley Fair Mall, he response was "Whoever said the money couldn't buy everything doesn't know where to shop, besides the best things in life go on sale sooner or later." Well, we didn't disagree with her, but as we were about to ask her a second question, well-dressed man came up to us, thinking our group has some authority and asked, " Can I pay my MasterCard with my Visa?" We left the mall as soon we could.
	A conclusion our pollsters came to was that people did feel positive about the future, and most people feel that. "Health and Wealth and that one should hold on tight to your dreams."
	The last person we polled truly put life in its proper perspective when he said, "You never know how many friends you have until you rent a place at the beach."
 Thought of the day - "Remember, nobody is perfect."

            During writing the story, it has revealed to me that the upcoming year will absolutely contain the usual 12 months in their regular sequence. The same holds true for the days of the week. Recent attempts to have the Spring and Summer months immediately follow December were unsuccessful. Of equal importance, attempts to rename all the days of the week, Saturday and Sunday, thus eliminating the entire workweek from the calendar, were also squelched.<p>The story continues to unfold as this article is written, and in this reporter's opinion, this remarkable attempt will once again fail, so here is how the coming year will unfold! Just Fabulous!</p></div>
